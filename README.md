# 🪙 Coin Toss

> **Heads or Tails? Click once, and let fate decide!**  
> A minimalist, joyful coin flipper built with Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS.

## 🌟 Why You’ll Love It

I built this because **most coin flippers are bloated** — full of ads, trackers, or unnecessary animations. So I made one that’s:

- 🔁 **Truly random** — no hidden biases  
- 📱 **Works perfectly on mobile** — no more tiny buttons  
- ✂️ **One-click flip** — instant result, zero friction  
- 🎨 **Clean & joyful** — because flipping a coin should be fun!
